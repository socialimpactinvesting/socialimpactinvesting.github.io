# Introduction 

*"Society is demanding that companies, both public and private, serve a social purpose. To prosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society."* - Laurence D. Fink, CEO BlackRock (largest asset manager in the world)

Asset managers are increasingly challenged by their investors to manage their portfolios for social impact. However, it is non-trivial for investors and investment managers to maintain regular oversight over the social impact composition of their portfolios. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC’s) EDGAR maintains a digital record of the portfolio filings of publicly traded asset managers. All the News is a Kaggle dataset of news articles primarily from 2016 to 2017. 

Furthermore, it could be interesting to correlate the greater public's interest into social good projects expressed on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, or news platforms, with the actual investments that are done.
